# Requirements

This section details what you are going to need to follow this guide. If you are already familiar with memory hacking and just want to learn about MindControl features, you can skip over to the [Project setup](#todo) section.

## Grab the test game

Throughout the guide, we are going to always use the same target program, so that you can follow along by repeating the same steps.

That target program is going to be the demo of a game called **Slime Rancher**, from the independent studio **Monomi Park**. It's a fun first-person adventure game about capturing wild monsters called slimes and making money with resources harvested from them. It's available on Steam. You can download the demo for free [on the Steam store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/433340/Slime_Rancher/). **Make sure to use the free demo version**, even if you have the full game, so that the exact same steps shown in this guide work for you.

The demo is a little bit outdated compared to the full game, is limited in time and doesn't save your progress, but fits our needs perfectly and is still enjoyable.

> As an aside, if you happen to enjoy the demo, consider buying the full game to have some fun and support the team behind it. Also check out the sequel, [Slime Rancher 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1657630/Slime_Rancher_2/).

## Install Cheat Engine

Cheat Engine is a popular memory hacking tool that allows you to inspect and manipulate the memory of a running process. It's a great tool to learn about memory hacking, and it's also useful to complement MindControl, as it provides a set of tools to inspect memory, and lots more.

You can download the latest Cheat Engine installer from its [official website](https://www.cheatengine.org/). The installer is safe to use, but has bundled software offers during the installation process. Make sure to decline these if you don't want them.

## Setting up the game

Before continuing further in the guide, make sure you boot up the game, start a new game, and clear the tutorial to understand how the game works. It should only take a couple of minutes, at most.

When you're done, in the game settings, you can turn off tutorials for the next times you'll boot up the game. It's also recommended to set the game in windowed mode, as we will be switching between the game and Cheat Engine a lot.

## Next step

The next section will be about setting up Cheat Engine and exploring basic memory concepts.
